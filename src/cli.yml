about: This tool creates a profile plot for scores over sets of genomic regions. Typically, these regions are genes, but any other regions defined in BED will work.
subcommands:
    - reference-point:
          about: "Reference-point refers to a position within a BED region (e.g., the starting point). In this mode, only those genomic positions before (upstream) and/or after (downstream) of the reference point will be plotted."
